                    <p>
                        At the beginning of September 2021 I started my internship at Total Design. The reason I chose Total Design was because I was very inspired by their website and the assignments they had made before. At this company I immediately got the idea that I could develop myself here, so I wanted to do an internship here. In addition, I was able to work here as a UX intern, which was in line with the choice I had made regarding the direction I want to go in. <br> <br> <i>Note: Unfortunately, due to copyrights, I can't show all my projects.</i>

                    <h1>Reflection on my internship</h1>
                    <p>
                        When I look back on my internship at Total Design, I learned a lot from all the projects I worked on and from my colleagues. The difference between the first and last weeks is very big when I look back on this, because I learned a lot of things and gained different experiences during the projects I did. I found it a very educational and fun company that I recommend to everyone. I have worked on several projects and hope that my contribution during my internship period has been of added value to Total Design. <br> <br> In hindsight, I think there were definitely things that I could have done better or in a different way. This is because I now have much more experience than at the start of my internship. That's why I think maybe choices I made in the first weeks regarding my projects might be different now. <br> <br> All in all I am very satisfied with my internship at Total Design. I have been able to develop myself as a designer and I am now also convinced that this is what I want to do in the future. I will certainly be able to apply all the knowledge I gained during this internship during my graduation.
